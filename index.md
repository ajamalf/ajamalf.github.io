### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 2, was one of my favorites because it was the first lab that was really challenging, making it all the more rewarding. It helped me get comfortable with all the fundamental aspects of doing labs, such as git add/status/commit, and it helped me learn how to debug properly. All of these aspects of the lab made it very rewarding when our program finally passed.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1, was one of my favorites because it was one of the first major times we worked on “if statements.” It helped me broaden my understanding of them and gave me a great foundation to work with them in the future.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 2, was another of my favorites because it was unique compared to anything we had done before. We worked with for loops, and while we had worked with them before, this utilized them more than previous labs, highlighting how powerful they can generate cool and unique patterns.
